    Dear Marsha,<br><br>
    Happy Birthday! Wishing you after almost 5 years. This birthday of yours makes me so emotional. I haven’t been there with you on this day for the past 5 years. But this year, by the grace of the Almighty, we’re back together.<br><br>
    Marsha, you are someone very close to my heart. Yet, we don’t even have a picture together—only lots of unforgettable memories. Today, my words aren’t filled with celebratory vibes; they’re more emotional.<br><br>
    I still remember the day you exchanged your seat with Anjali just to sit beside me. You were the first person in whom I found a true sense of friendship. Marsha, I can’t forget our little “murder plans” for Sarkar Ma’am and Ravinder Sir. And how I used to blackmail you into playing Ravinder Sir in our game by saying, “Tum Ravinder Sir nahi banogi toh main Maths period mein answers nahi bataungi.” How evil of me to say such things! Do you remember how jealous people were of our friendship that they separated our seats.😏<br><br>
    I remember how our lives changed when POM Ma’am entered. There wasn’t a day we didn’t mimic her… and ship her with our “Enemy.” Giving unique nicknames to classmates—that was something I learnt from you.<br><br>
    Marsha, those days with you were truly worth living. Not a single day passed without us bursting into pearls of laughter. Remember—“A day with butter without bread”? All I have now are those uncaptured memories, but they’ll never fade.<br><br>
    I can proudly say it was only you who made my school days so enjoyable. Honestly, I wouldn’t have had the will to go to school if you weren’t there in my life. When I found a friend like you, I truly thanked Allah. And believe me, you were enough for me. I never wished to make any other friends while you were around.<br><br>
    After 10th, we lost the sparkle in our friendship. That was such a huge turning point in my life. I never knew I could grow so close to someone that their absence would matter so much. Yes, I did find Ipsita in 11th grade, and eventually, we became good friends. But I always used to think about you. I longed for our togetherness.<br><br>
    Aap mere khayal se kabhi reha nahi hui… Your energy was that strong, bruh. Even surrounded by other friends, I kept thinking about you. I believe it’s because of how your presence made me feel.<br><br>
    I remember how I used to read our old chats… Marsha, I’m grateful to have you back. Ever since we regained contact, you’ve always been there for me. Thank you for that. Thank you for the days when you heard me crying on the call and soothing me. I have a guilt of not being there for you in your bad times.<br><br>
    I wish we could be together to celebrate your day. May Allah bless you with hidayah. May Allah strengthen your imaan. May Allah grant you success in this world and the Hereafter.<br><br>
    My friend, I’m sorry for everything that happened. And thank you again for understanding me in my hard times. I know it's not easy for you to understand me everytime and say "it's alright", my actions might be hurtful but you always understood me, I appreciate that. It must be difficult for you to let go of things.. This flexibility stands you out.<br><br>
    Again, Happy Birthday Marsha.<br>
    Love you, sis. ❤
